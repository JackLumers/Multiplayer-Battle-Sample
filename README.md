# MultiplayerBattleSample
Made by Ilyas Kharisov a.k.a. Jack Lumers.

A sample game with local multiplayer. Getting myself knowing Mirror Networking.

# Project Setup
1. Clone git repo, download PC build (windows only)
2. Open in Unity 2021.3.24f1 (not tested on other versions but probably will work fine);
3. Enter playmode, chose whatever you host or connect to existing room (using local network IP, port 7777)
4. Run a built game, chose whatever you host or connect to existing room.

# Building your own version
No any special preparations, but I build using configuration as follows:
1. Mono scripting backend.
2. Windows standalone platform. Not tested on others.
